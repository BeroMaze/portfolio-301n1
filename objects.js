This website is for people to come check out what the camp is about and what all they bring to the community. There are many different pages; About page, drink Voting page, Countdown page, Game Page, and a thank you page. Head over to the Whalephants website and vote on the next drinks that they will be making out at Burning Man or go over and play the Hang Man game.

    description:  'For the Kitten Voting Contest we where asked to set up a voting app that when through 14 different kitten pictures and asked the user to vote on one. once the user has gone through all the kittens the app changes to a chart and all the pictures of the kittens that you could vote on. For this project we had to focus in using Jquery and object junctions. This project had a lot of adding and taking away from the page. I also used a chart to show the resaults. for storing the voting information I set up a local storeage json function so that you could simulate multiply people voting on the images.'
