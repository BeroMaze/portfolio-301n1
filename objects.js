    description:  '<p>For the Kitten Voting Contest we where asked to set up a voting app that when through 14 different kitten pictures and asked the user to vote on one. once the user has gone through all the kittens the app changes to a chart and all the pictures of the kittens that you could vote on.</p> <p>For this project we had to focus in using Jquery and object junctions. This project had a lot of adding and taking away from the page. I also used a chart to show the resaults. for storing the voting information I set up a local storeage json function so that you could simulate multiply people voting on the images.</p>'
